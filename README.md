## Overview

This is a beginner-friendly Android app that demonstrates the use of ViewModel, Room Database, and Coroutines to manage data and perform asynchronous operations efficiently. The app is a simple task manager that allows users to add, update, and delete user info.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- Android Studio installed on your computer
- Basic knowledge of Kotlin programming language and Android development
- Familiarity with Android Studio and building Android apps

## Features
- Add a new user
- View existing users
- Update user info
- Delete users

## Libraries Used

- Room Database: For local data storage and management.
- ViewModel: To manage UI-related data and handle configuration changes.
- LiveData: To observe data changes in the ViewModel and update the UI accordingly.
- Coroutines: To handle asynchronous tasks in a structured and concise manner.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows: 
* app/src/main/java/com/example/taskmanager/:
- data/: Contains the data-related classes such as database, DAO, and repository.
- model/: Defines the data models used in the app.
-  ui/: Contains all the activities and adapters used for the user interface.
- viewmodel/: Houses the ViewModel classes.

## Implementing ViewModel

ViewModel helps in managing UI-related data and surviving configuration changes. It allows the app to be lifecycle-aware, so data is retained across device rotations or other configuration changes. The ViewModel communicates with the Repository to fetch or store data.

## Implementing Room Database

Room is a part of Android Architecture Components and provides an abstraction layer over SQLite database. It simplifies database operations and helps to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently. The app's data will be stored in the Room Database.

## Using Coroutines

Coroutines offer a way to perform asynchronous tasks in a more concise and readable way. It helps in avoiding callback hell and easily handles background operations. We'll use coroutines to perform database operations on a background thread without blocking the main thread.

## Conclusion

This app is a basic yet practical example of how to implement ViewModel, Room Database, and Coroutines in an Android application. Feel free to explore and modify the code to learn more about these essential components and improve your Android development skills.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
